# Background substraction.
An application made for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) class. Using Python and OpenCV to turn the background into grayscale and main objects into color. <br/>
As can be seen in the image below, a background was first selected to be the wall a Rubikâ€™s cube, while the video was running a Lego figure was put in the frame, this figure is then filter as a color image while the background remains in grayscale.<br/>

# GUI
The GUI consist of various labels, two video displays, two buttons and a slider. <br/>
The two buttons and the sliders work as the main control for the user, with one button being the "set new background" button, and the other saves the image in the folder of the application. <br/>
The slider helps change the threshold to help filter the colors from the video. <br/>
Examples for the GUI and the application being used will be shown below. <br/>
